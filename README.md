# Neovim Configuration

Built initially from [typecraft's excellent YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY&list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn&pp=iAQB).

## Installation

After cloning this repository, use a symbolic link to point nvim to it. Beware that the first command here will delete any existing nvim configuration that is present. You may want to copy it to a backup location first, just in case.

```shell
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
ln -s $(pwd)/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```
